# Unhandled NullPointerException in Firebase Data Access
This repository demonstrates a common error when working with nested data in the Firebase Realtime Database: accessing fields without checking for null values.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

**Problem:**
Accessing deeply nested data without proper null checks can result in unexpected `TypeError` or `NullPointerException` errors, especially when data is asynchronous or incomplete. 

**Solution:**
The solution involves adding null checks at each level to ensure that a field exists before accessing its children.  This prevents errors and improves the robustness of the code.
